## e-commerce-back-end

# Summary of Project

On this assignment we were given starter code to help build a back end e-commerce application.  We used Express, MySQL, Sequelize, and Node.js.  Our sequalize models and index.js were started and we had to build the tables and relationships between the models.  We then had to build CRUD Routes for Category, Product, and ProductTag.
